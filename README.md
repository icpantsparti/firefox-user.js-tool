#### userjs-tool.html
Offline interactive viewer and actions for Firefox user.js (ghacksuserjs, pyllyukko, etc).

Display a Mozilla Firefox user.js settings file contents in your Firefox browser, with:
* highlighting, links, themes*, re-size, wrap, about:config?filter links and groups
* expanding sections, and "go to" section links, with compatible user.js projects
* user-overrides.js* template, point and click overrides collector, append* (with comment-out), and prefs.js cleaner*
* copy/paste or load/auto-load from local user.js files

(*[ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) inspired, as is the dark/light theme.  Please visit them and read [ghacks-user.js wiki info](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki), they have nice scripts which better handle append/clean and more)

This was an over the top experiment for learning some HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Disclaimer: Use with care at your own risk, alpha/experimental/untested.
This is a viewer/tool, and not an editor/installer.
