(*[ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) inspired, as is the dark/light/HTML theme.  Please visit them and read [ghacks-user.js wiki info](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki), they have nice scripts which better handle append/clean and more)

This was an over the top experiment for learning some HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
This is a viewer/tool, and not an editor/installer.
Disclaimer: Use with care at your own risk, alpha/experimental/untested.
