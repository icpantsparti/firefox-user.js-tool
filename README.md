### userjs-tool.html
Offline HTML viewer and actions for Firefox user.js (ghacksuserjs, pyllyukko, etc)

Display a Mozilla Firefox user.js settings file contents in your Firefox browser, with: highlighting, links, themes*, re-size, wrap, about:config?filter links.

Expanding sections, and "go to" section links, with compatible user.js projects.

Plus: user-overrides.js* template, point and click overrides collector, append* (with comment-out), and prefs.js cleaner*.

Copy/paste or load/auto-load from local user.js files.

(*[ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) inspired, as is the dark/light theme.  Please visit them and read their [wiki/info](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki), they have nice scripts which fully handle append/clean/more)

This was an over the top experiment for learning some HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Disclaimer: Use with care at your own risk, alpha/experimental/untested.

(This is a viewer/tool, and not an editor/installer.)
