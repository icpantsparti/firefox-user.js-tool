version 2020.02.22 (alpha/experimental)

Main:

+ [Compare] preferences in two user.js, in a table format with order/layout
  options and bold cell border around differences

* [Load] button can also use the browser local file select dialog, plus
  drag/drop.  Added some URL options, and auto-load/view using URL parameters

* Altered the 'about:config?filter=' links/[Groups] format for FF71+
  (paste them into about:config search box, multi pref regex search works)

+ [a:c Functions] button for find (filter/list)/reset/set on about:config Web Console

* updated layout

More:

+ now recognize in-block (multi-line) comments (not just in-line comments)

+ [View] has extra spacing with ghacksuserjs, and comments displayed in-line
  (makes /*user_pref*/ (in comment blocks) show //user_pref)
  (View+ style menu option can disable this)

+ show a message (and help/info section) if JavaScript disabled

* re-arrange interface and text boxes:
    * default to 100% text size, previously 75%
    * swapped box 1 and 3 around
    + buttons to change input box shown (or view all)
    * actions buttons now in one group below the input boxes
    - "Easy view / Links" input box no longer required
    * "Links" (user.js templates/information) remain as [Examples]
    + [Actions] button added at top
    + [Values] button renamed [By Value] and improved
      (useful when manually reviewing/setting preferences on Android)
    + [Group] button renamed [To Group]
    + [Encode] has extra options (plus option from removed [Decode] button)
    * panel close button moved to top button bar
    + [Reduce] button added (comment stripper)

version 2019.01.17.alpha

+ [Values] button (below box 4)

  to show user_pref grouped by value
  useful if manually setting up Android Firefox
  (eg you can then use about:config?filter "Groups" to show
  the prefs you want to set as false/true/etc)

+ [End Collect] button (next to Box 2)

  hidden until overrides collector is used
  added due to changed position of "Collect" button (which was dual purpose)

+ [Actions] button (on "Easy View")

  to take you to "Actions" menu option
  (the "..." menu has this option already)

version 2019.01.07.alpha

+ "Easy View" option

  enabled GitHub Pages on this repo
  so now "userjs-tool.html?easy=true" opens an added "Easy View" option
  which is nicer when opening the html online
  simpler: one text entry box and view/clear button
  the usual "Actions" option still opens as default otherwise

+ toggleBox function

  had 3 similar box toggling functions, needed a 4th, now combined

* moved example user.js links

  from "Actions" to the new "Easy View"

* other minor re-wording and coding
