version 2019.01.17.alpha

+ [Values] button (below box 4)

  to show user_pref grouped by value
  useful if manually setting up Android Firefox
  (eg you can then use about:config?filter "Groups" to show
  the prefs you want to set as false/true/etc)

+ [End Collect] button (next to Box 2)

  hidden until overrides collector is used
  added due to changed position of "Collect" button (which was dual purpose)

+ [Actions] button (on "Easy View")

  to take you to "Actions" menu option
  (the "..." menu has this option already)

+ [Examples] button (below box 3)

  to take you to "Easy View / Links" menu option (for example user.js links)
  (the "..." menu has this option already)

* improved buttons layout on "Actions"

  common buttons remain vertical
  other actions now horizontal

* other minor re-wording and coding




version 2019.01.07.alpha

+ "Easy View" option

  enabled GitHub Pages on this repo
  so now "userjs-tool.html?easy=true" opens an added "Easy View" option
  which is nicer when opening the html online
  simpler: one text entry box and view/clear button
  the usual "Actions" option still opens as default otherwise

+ toggleBox function

  had 3 similar box toggling functions, needed a 4th, now combined

* moved example user.js links

  from "Actions" to the new "Easy View"

* other minor re-wording and coding
